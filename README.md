# Skyper

A simple program to write words with Skype emoticons.

## How to run
 
You can pass in values from the command line, or enter them at the prompt, and the result will be copied to your clipboard. 

```> ruby skyper.rb <text_input> <emoticon_name>```

An example of this would be 

```> ruby skyper.rb kyle cool```

or you could enter them at the prompt, like so

```
> ruby skyper.rb
Enter the text you want to write: 
kyle
Enter the emoticon you want to use: 
cool
```

Either way produces a result which looks like this when pasted into skype
